# auto-panning-using-motion-detection-camera

Developed this project in my second year of college. The device uses Passive infrared motion sensors to detect presence of people and pans towards that direction to increase coverage of surveillance system.

Files include
- Proteus file with circuit design
- Another Proteus file for PCB designing
- HEX file to load in the microcontroller (in the program folder)
